🍽️ Meal Planner App
The Meal Planner App is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project that lets users add and view meals. The React frontend sends requests to an Express backend, which stores meal data in a MongoDB Atlas database. The app is designed to practice full-stack development by building a basic CRUD-style system with clean routing, components, and API communication.
